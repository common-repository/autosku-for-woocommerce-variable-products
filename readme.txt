== Description ==

Automatically assign unique SKU to all your product variations, adding a letter (a, b, c, ...) to the main product SKU.
Assegna automaticamente un codice unico SKU a tutte le variazioni del prodotto, aggiungendo una lettera (a,b,c, ...) allo SKU del prodotto principale.

Tested up to WooCommerce 3.4.0

Respect to other SKU generators, we needed a simple tool that produces a very short SKU code, to be easily written even on a barcode.

Usage is very simple.

* Assign a SKU to the main product (e.g. "089")
* Search the autoSKU (wheel) icon on the right side of the SKU field.
* Click on the autoSKU icon. 
* Check the SKU (e.g. "089a", "089b", ...) assigned to each variations.

It doesn't overwrite existent SKUs.
It works only for variable product.
